"""Load an imaging system from a YAML file.

The presets in :mod:`afocus.optics.system` cover common objectives, but a real
microscope is never exactly one of them: the tube lens, the coverglass, the
camera and the emission filter all differ, and those differences move best
focus by micrometres (see :class:`afocus.sim.render.FocalShift`).  A dataset
generated for a specific instrument therefore has to start from that
instrument's numbers.

Only the fields that matter need to be given; everything else falls back to the
named preset, or to the dataclass defaults if no preset is named.  What matters
most, in rough order:

1. ``objective.na`` and ``objective.magnification`` -- set resolution, depth of
   field and the sampling ratio.
2. ``camera.pixel_size`` -- with the magnification, sets the sample-plane pixel
   and hence whether the PSF is sampled at all.
3. ``stack.n_sample`` against ``objective.n_immersion`` -- sets the
   depth-dependent focal shift and the spherical aberration that makes the sign
   of defocus recoverable.
4. ``stack.t_glass`` against ``t_glass_design`` -- a constant focus offset, and
   a large one: at 60x a 8 um error moves best focus by about 8 um.
5. ``illumination.wavelength`` -- the emission band actually reaching the camera.
